## ðŸ¤– AI Assistant Troubleshooting

### AI Not Responding?
If the AI chat seems disconnected, here's what to check:

1. **Check Servers Are Running:**
   ```bash
   # Check backend (port 3001)
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
   
   # Check frontend (port 3000) 
   curl http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Test AI Directly:**
   ```bash
   # Test AI service endpoint
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/chat/test-ai \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "hello"}'
   ```

3. **Visit AI Test Page:**
   - Go to: **http://localhost:3000/ai-test**
   - Try the quick test buttons
   - AI works **offline** - no internet required!

4. **Restart If Needed:**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend && npm run dev
   
   # Frontend  
   cd frontend && npm start
   ```

### âœ… AI Status Indicators
- **Working**: Responses appear instantly with confidence scores
- **Demo Mode**: Responses work but show "[Demo Mode]" 
- **Offline**: AI works without internet connection
- **Fallback**: Connects you to human support if AI can't help

### ðŸ”§ Advanced Troubleshooting
- **Multiple servers**: Kill all node processes and restart
- **Port conflicts**: Check ports 3000 and 3001 are available
- **Database**: PostgreSQL must be running for chat history
- **CORS**: Frontend at localhost:3000 can access backend at localhost:3001

**Remember:** The AI is rule-based and works locally - no API keys or internet needed!
